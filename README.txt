# PingPongGame
The game has been made for the resolution of 1366 * 768 DISPLAY!!
Also this game is my first Development Project so don't expect perfection!!
It contains all the cpp files, use Visual Studio C++ and then create new Project with SFML installed in it,
And then copy the code. Put resource source and, header files in the created SFML installed Project!!
If you aren't able to see all the objects, Position values can be changed accordingly!
